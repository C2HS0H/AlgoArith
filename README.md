## Computer Arithmetic Calculator

This project is a web-based tool that visualizes fundamental computer arithmetic algorithms. It was built as a hands-on learning exercise to better understand the inner workings of Booth's multiplication and Restoring division. The calculator interactively demonstrates each step of these processes, offering a clearer insight into how these crucial operations are performed at a machine level.
